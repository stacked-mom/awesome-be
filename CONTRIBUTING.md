## Guidelines

Pull requests need to follow these guidelines to be merged

1. No links to stolen/reuploaded content
1. Sort lists alphabetically
1. No duplicates within categories
1. If a creator has multiple links, prefer linking to their main revenue source
1. If a creator has no links at all (free/paid), just use a search term instead
